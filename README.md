This is a Python Flask Web App created using Google Text Editor and Google Cloud Shell and deployed as an application using Google App
Engine (gcloud app deploy). This project is to read the CSV file data of the fictional boat S.S Minnow and make charts for better 
comprehension.

The Display includes :-
1. Barchart of Age Vs Fare (Customizable) [Used Google Chart]
2. Piechart of Age of Survivors between 10 and 40 (All attributes are customizable) [Used Google Chart]
3. Scatter Plot of Survivor Vs Age (Customizable) (In plot X-axis : 0:Nonsurvivor, 1:Survivor) [Used Google Chart]
4. Image display of the Captain of S.S Minnow
